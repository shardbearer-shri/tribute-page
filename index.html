                Norman Ernest Borlaug was an American agronomist
                who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production
                termed the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work, including the Nobel Peace
                Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. Here's a brief timeline of

                    <blockquote>"We will have to double the world food supply by 2050."</blockquote> Argues that
                    genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable
                    land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because - <blockquote>"We've been genetically
                        modifying
                        plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the
                        best breeds."</blockquote>
